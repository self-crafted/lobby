Lobby is a [Minestom](https://github.com/Minestom/Minestom) extension adding lobby world to the server.

Requires Java 17.<br>
Works well with [Microstom](https://github.com/KlainStom/microstom).

### Features
- Load lobby world from disk (Anvil format)
- Use the anvil worlds world spawn, time and doDaylightCycle settings
- Teleport players falling into the void to world spawn

### Future features
- Have a configurable maximum of players on one instance to create a new one
- Add a server menu (as integration with an automatic network system)
